    CHATTER - A Next.js Content Creation Platform

    This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, designed as a modern Content Creation platform called Chatter. It provides a user-friendly interface for writers to create content, personalize their experience, and connect with a community, leveraging Firebase for authentication and a responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS.


    PROJECT OVERVIEW
    Chatter is built for writers of all levels—new bloggers, professional writers, and casual creators. It features an onboarding process to personalize the user experience, a dashboard for content creation, and a social feed to explore community content. The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.
    Key Features
    User Authentication: Sign up, log in, and log out using Firebase Authentication.

    Onboarding Flow: Select your writer type (New Blogger, Professional Writer, or Casual Writer) to tailor your experience.

    Responsive Design: Fully functional on mobile and desktop with Tailwind CSS.

    Interactive Header: Includes navigation, account management, and a comprehensive help guide.

    Content Creation: Access a dashboard to set up profiles and start writing.

    Social Feed: Explore content from other writers (post-setup).

    Help Guide: Built-in instructions for navigating and using the app.
